# Vote On It
I created this side project as a solution to a [Free Code Camp project suggestion](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app).  I used Angular 2 (written in TypeScript) as a front-end, Node.js (with ExpressJS as a framework) as a back-end and MongoDB as a database.
## Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/AryanJ-NYC/voting-app.git`
2. `cd voting-app`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm install nodemon -g`
5. `touch .env`
6. In `.env`, instantiate `MONGODB_URI` and `PASSPORT_SECRET` as directed (please contact me privately for more information)
7. `npm run dev`
8. Visit `localhost:8080` in browser
